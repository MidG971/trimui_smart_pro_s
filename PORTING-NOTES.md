# Trimui Smart Pro S — Mainline Porting Notes

Status board: **A523-PRO2-AXP717C** · SoC **Allwinner A523 (sun55iw3p1)** · model TG5050.
Authoritative hardware reference: decompiled vendor DTB → `trimui_smart_pro_source.dts`
(model `sun55iw3`, board `A523\0A523-PRO2-AXP717C`, compatible `allwinner,a523 / arm,sun55iw3p1`).

## Progress (updated 2026-06-04, before hardware arrival)

> **⚠️ Superseded in places by on-hardware findings (device in hand since 2026-07-22).**
> Several pre-hardware assumptions below were corrected on live silicon — the authoritative
> current state is [`docs/ON-DEVICE-FINDINGS.md`](docs/ON-DEVICE-FINDINGS.md). Most notably:
> the big-cluster CPU regulator is **axp1530@0x36** (not tcs4838 — 0x41 is absent); the
> analog **sticks come from the uart5 (PK17) + uart7 (PK13) gamepad MCUs** via
> `trimui_inputd`→uinput, **not GPADC**; and the main PMIC is confirmed **AXP2202@0x34**
> (driven by the mainline `axp717` driver). The §3 "verify on HW" list is largely answered there.

Hardware ordered, in transit. Much of the bring-up groundwork was done up front by
mining the stock firmware (no device needed) — see [`FIRMWARE-FINDINGS.md`](FIRMWARE-FINDINGS.md).

**Resolved from firmware (was "verify on HW"):**
- WiFi/BT = **AICSemi AIC8800** (D80/DC), SDIO mmc1 + UART BT — out-of-tree module.
- Battery = **5000 mAh**, 1000 mA charge.
- Input = **AXP2202 PEK** (power) + **LRADC** `keyboard_1350mv` 3 keys (volume) +
  userspace `trimui_inputd` for the main pad — *not* a pure USB MCU as first feared.
- Shell on stock OS = **`adb` over USB-C** (adbd autostarts); serial console on ttyS0.
- PMIC driven by vendor as **axp2202** at 0x34 (chip ID still to confirm on HW).

**Boot path built (no device needed):** mainline U-Boot v2025.10+ has full A523 support
incl. SPL DRAM init. Built `avaota-a1`-based U-Boot + TF-A `sun50i_h616` BL31 stand-in,
then **extracted this board's LPDDR4 DRAM params from the vendor boot0** and produced
[`uboot/trimui-tg5050_defconfig`](uboot/trimui-tg5050_defconfig) (see
[`uboot/DRAM-PARAMS.md`](uboot/DRAM-PARAMS.md)). Image is FEL-bootable (RAM-only, brick-safe).

**Day-1 plan:** back up eMMC → enter FEL → `sunxi-fel -v uboot u-boot-sunxi-with-spl-trimui.bin`
→ serial console → run [`recon.sh`](recon.sh) for the residual HW-only facts (§3 below).

**Still strictly HW-gated:** PMIC chip ID @0x34, populated CPU regulator (0x36/0x41/0x60),
AIC8800 variant, gamepad kernel source, eMMC/SD partition map, and whether the mainline
A523 DRAM driver trains with the extracted params.

## 0. Reality check — mainline A523 maturity (READ FIRST)

Mainline `sun55i-a523.dtsi` (Arm Ltd, 6.13+) currently exposes **only**:

| Present in mainline | Missing in mainline (no driver/node yet) |
|---|---|
| CPU cores (A55), PSCI, GIC | Display engine (DE3.5), TCON, **MIPI-DSI** |
| CCU / R-CCU clocks | **PWM** (backlight) |
| MMC0/1/2 | **GPADC** (analog sticks) |
| UART0-7 | **LRADC** |
| I2C0-5, **R-I2C0** | **Audio codec / I2S / DAI** |
| USB (otg, ehci0/1, ohci0/1, phy) | NPU / VE (video decode) / G2D |
| RTC, watchdog, NMI, r_pio | Mali GPU |

**Consequence:** screen, backlight, audio, analog sticks, video decode and GPU
cannot work on a current mainline tree yet — the SoC sub-drivers don't exist.
A realistic port is **phased**: get a serial console + storage + USB + PMIC + WiFi
first; display/audio/sticks/GPU come later as those SoC drivers are mainlined
(or written). Any DTS that references `&dsi0`, `&pwm`, `&gpadc`, `&lradc`,
`&codec`, `&de`, `&tcon0` will fail `dtc`/kbuild against mainline today.

**Update (docs acquired):** we now have the **A523 Datasheet** (pinout/electrical)
and the full **1909-page register User Manual**. See `docs/A523-DOCS-INDEX.md`
(chapter→page map + memory map) and `docs/BOARD-PINMAP.md`. This *unblocks at the
spec level* the peripherals above — DE/DSI/GPADC/LRADC/PWM/codec register maps are
now in hand, so those drivers can be **written or ported** (not just waited on).
The gating work shifts from "missing documentation" to "missing/un-upstreamed driver
code." Both PDFs are Allwinner **Confidential** → keep local, never commit to the repo.

## 1. Hardware truth table (from vendor DTB)

| Subsystem | Vendor fact | Mainline target |
|---|---|---|
| **Main PMIC** | `pmu@34` = `x-powers,axp2202`, reg `0x34`, on **s_twi0** (`r_i2c0`), drive-vbus, IRQ via NMI. Board silk says **AXP717C**. | `r_i2c0` + `x-powers,axp717` driver *(chip = **AXP2202**, confirmed on HW; an axp2202 compatible may be needed upstream)*. NOT on `i2c0`. |
| **CPU supply (dual cluster)** | cluster0 (cpu@0) `cpu-supply` → **axp2202-dcdc1**; cluster1 (cpu@400) `cpu-supply` → **axp1530-dcdc1** (`axp1530@0x36` on r_i2c0). Populated external CPU regulator = **axp1530@0x36** — CONFIRMED ON HW (0x41 tcs4838 absent; the tcs4838 guess was wrong). | Two separate `cpu-supply` per cluster: little=axp2202 dcdc1, big=axp1530 dcdc1 (`x-powers,axp1530`, already mainline). |
| **Fan** | `pwm-fan`, pwms = ch **10**, 40000 ns, **inverted**. 32 cooling levels. | `pwm-fan` once A523 PWM driver lands. |
| **Vibrator** | `pwm-vibrator`, pwms = ch **7**, 50000 ns, normal polarity. | `pwm-vibrator` once PWM driver lands. |
| **Ethernet** | gmac0 + gmac1 present in vendor DTB (SoC MACs); handheld likely has no RJ45. | Ignore unless a port exists. |
| **LEDs / BT(brcm) / gpio-keys** | **0 hits in vendor DTB** — not present. | Do not add; fabricated if seen elsewhere. |
| **Battery/charger** | axp2202 bat + usb power supply, type-C, vbus detect GPIO. | axp717 power-supply + `simple-battery` (need real mAh/voltages). |
| **eMMC** | mmc2, 8-bit, non-removable, HS200/HS400 1.8V. PC pins. | `&mmc2` bus-width 8, mmc-hs200/hs400-1_8v, non-removable. |
| **microSD** | mmc0, 4-bit, CD = **PF6** active-low, UHS (sdr104/ddr50). | `&mmc0` cd-gpios `<&pio 5 6 ...>`, vmmc/vqmmc from PMIC. |
| **WiFi/BT** | `sunxi-rfkill`+`sunxi-wlan`, **SDIO on mmc1 (bus 1)**, chip = **AIC8800D80** (HW-confirmed; **`wlan0` works**). Power = axp2202 aldo3(3.3V)+bldo1(1.8V)+bldo2(1.8V). Control on **R_PIO**: `power_en`=**PL7**, `chip_en`=**PM5**, `wlan_regon`=**PM1**, `wlan_hostwake`=**PM0**; `bt_rst_n`=**PM2**, `bt_wake`=**PM3**, `bt_hostwake`=**PM4**. BT HCI = UART1 (PG6-9). | `&mmc1` non-removable + `wifi_pwrseq` driving **all three of PL7+PM5+PM1** (driving only PM1 = chip silent to CMD5) + **25 MHz cap** (A523 HS read sample-phase uncalibrated → `RD DCE`) + 3.3V (`no-1-8-v`). AIC8800 = out-of-tree module; fw in `/lib/firmware/aic8800_sdio/`. ⚠️ earlier PB0/PB1 was a bad decode (`0x5a`=r_pio). |
| **Display** | MIPI-**DSI1** (`dsi1@5508000` is `okay`; dsi0 is `disabled`), **4-lane**, RGB888, combo-phy DSI1 @ 0x5508000. Lanes = **PD10–PD19**, panel reset = **PD22** (120 ms). Panel **720×1280@60**, 62 MHz pclk. Vendor DTB has the full MIPI DCS init sequence. Backlight = PWM (50000 ns). | Needs A523 DE+DSI driver (write/port) — now **fully specced** (UM §5.1/6.2/6.3 + vendor timings/init). Reuse vendor `panel-init-sequence`. |
| **Backlight** | sunxi-pwm-v201. | Blocked until A523 PWM driver in mainline. |
| **Analog sticks** | **gpadc0** (2ch) + **gpadc1** (2ch) = 2 sticks × X/Y. | `adc-joystick` binding once GPADC driver exists. |
| **Buttons (D-pad/ABXY/L/R/Start/Select)** | **No gpio-keys / no key matrix in vendor DTS.** Almost certainly an **internal USB gamepad MCU** (or I2C MCU). | Investigate on HW (`lsusb`/`evtest`). Do **not** fabricate gpio-keys. |
| **Vol/Power/Home keys** | Check axp2202 PEK (power) + possibly LRADC/MCU for vol. | axp717 power button child; vol = TBD on HW. |
| **Audio** | analog + digital codec (sunxi). Speaker amp enable likely a GPIO. | Blocked until A523 codec driver in mainline. |
| **USB** | **Two external USB-C** connectors (mapping HW-verified in mainline): **BOTTOM = host** = `usb@4200000`/`4200400` (ehci1/ohci1, `&usbphy` port 1, VBUS switch = **PE6**); **TOP = OTG + charge** = `usb@4100000` (MUSB, `&usbphy` port 0; Type-C PD = `husb311@4e` on twi5; **5V/2A, charge-while-off, USB data capped 500 mA**). ⚠️ **CROSSED vs the vendor spec sheet** (sheet says Top=Host / Bottom=charge+OTG — the mainline mapping is the reverse; trust HW). Plus internal USB2 host ports (ehci0/ohci0). | **Bottom host = WORKING on HW** (kbd/mouse/SSD enumerate; `reg_usb1_vbus` on PE6 + `usb1_vbus-supply` on `&usbphy` port 1; pushed `ce232df`). **Top OTG/charge = BLOCKED**: needs `husb311` Type-C PD probing (twi5 bus locked low) + a `usb0-vbus` fixed-reg GPIO for host/gadget VBUS; USB-gadget-ethernet is HW-ready but does not enumerate yet. |

GPIO encoding in vendor DTS: `<phandle bank pin flags>`. **Two controllers:**
`phandle 0x59 = &pio` (banks A=0,B=1,…,K=10) and `phandle 0x5a = &r_pio` (PL=0, PM=1).
e.g. `<0x59 5 6 …>` = PF6, `<0x59 3 22 …>` = PD22, `<0x5a 1 1 …>` = **PM1** (NOT PB1 —
mind the phandle). Full validated board map: see `docs/BOARD-PINMAP.md`.

## 2. Review of existing DTS attempts

### `sun55i-t527-trimui-smart-pro_v0.1.1.dts`
- ❌ `#include "sun55i-t527.dtsi"` — no such file in mainline (base is `sun55i-a523.dtsi`).
- ❌ PMIC `axp2202@3a` on `&i2c0` — wrong addr (0x34) and wrong bus (it's on `r_i2c0`/s_twi0). compatible direction OK-ish.
- ❌ References `&dsi0`, `&pwm0`, `&lradc`, `&gpadc`, `&codec_analog/digital` — none exist in mainline → won't build.
- ⚠️ WiFi `brcm,bcm4329-fmac` is a guess; vendor uses generic sunxi-wlan, real chip unknown.
- ✅ DSI panel + 4 lanes + reset PD22 — *correct interface and reset pin* (matches vendor). Good instinct.
- ✅ mmc0 CD = PF6, eMMC HS200/HS400 — correct.
- ⚠️ `simple-audio-card` widgets/routing are plausible scaffolding but unverifiable now.

### `sun55i-t527-trimui-smart-pro_v0.1.2.dts`
- ✅ `#include "sun55i-a523.dtsi"` + compatible `allwinner,sun55i-a523` — correct base.
- ❌ PMIC `axp717c@0x34` on `&i2c0` — right address, **wrong bus** (must be `&r_i2c0`).
- ❌ Display reworked to **parallel RGB666** (`tcon0`, `lcd0_rgb666_pins`, `innolux,gc9503`) — **regression**: the panel is MIPI-DSI 4-lane (v0.1.1 was right).
- ❌ Big fabricated `gpio-keys` block (PG9–PG20) — vendor has no such GPIO buttons; buttons are via USB MCU. Invented.
- ❌ `realtek,rtl8723ds` on SPI — WiFi is SDIO (mmc1), not SPI, and chip is unidentified.
- ❌ References `&de`, `&tcon0`, `&mixer0`, `&pwm`, `&codec`, `&dai` — absent in mainline → won't build.
- ⚠️ Two files diverge on SoC name (t527 vs a523). Pick one: mainline base = **a523**; T527 is the same die, automotive bin — use `allwinner,sun55i-a523` as fallback compatible.

**Net:** v0.1.2 fixed the include but regressed the display and invented inputs/wifi.
The correct baseline merges: v0.1.2's a523 include + v0.1.1's DSI/reset, minus everything mainline can't build yet. See `sun55i-a523-trimui-smart-pro-s.dts`.

### Repo `dts/sun55i-a523-trimui-smart-pro-s.dts` (the "production-ready" one)

**It compiles, but a clean `dtc` build proves nothing about correctness.** `dtc`
only checks syntax + phandle resolution; it does NOT verify register addresses,
`compatible` strings, or that any driver exists. This file declares all the
missing peripherals as new nodes with invented addresses/compatibles, so a DTB
is produced — but most of it cannot bind or work on hardware.

| Item (line) | Problem | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `&i2c0` PMIC `pmic@34` (327) | PMIC is on **r_i2c0** (`i2c@7081400`), not i2c0 (`i2c@2502000`). Won't probe. | 🔴 |
| `x-powers,axp2202` (332) + `axp2202-battery-power` (383) | No mainline driver/binding for axp2202; mainline has axp717. Won't bind. | 🔴 |
| `usb@2000000/2001000/2002000` (273-324) | **Fabricated addresses** — real USB is 0x4100000/0x4101000/0x4101400/0x4200000/0x4200400, and these **duplicate** `usb_otg`/`ehci0/1`/`ohci0/1` already in the dtsi. | 🔴 |
| `gpadc@2009000` single, 4 ch (265) | Real HW = **two** blocks gpadc0@2009000 + gpadc1@2009c00 (2 ch each). `sun50i-a100-gpadc` ≠ mainline compatible; no A523 GPADC driver yet anyway. | 🔴 |
| `pwm@2000c00` `sun50i-a100-pwm` (257) | No mainline A523 PWM; compatible won't match the v201/v202 IP. (fan ch10 / vibrator ch7 channels ARE correct, though.) | 🔴 |
| `codec`/`codec_plat` `sun50i-a100-codec` (244-254) | Not the A523 codec; no mainline A523 audio. Won't bind. | 🔴 |
| `gpio-keys` PD12-21/PE10-14 (26-119) | **Invented** — vendor DTB has no gpio buttons (USB MCU). PD14-22 region overlaps display/LCD pins (PD22 = panel reset). | 🔴 |
| `gpio-leds` PG14/PG15 (156) | **Invented** — 0 hits in vendor DTB. | 🟠 |
| `brcm,bcm43438-bt` on uart1 + PB2/3/4 (395) | WiFi/BT chip **unidentified**; vendor uses generic sunxi-wlan over SDIO. BT chip + pins are guesses. | 🟠 |
| `cpu-supply = <&dcdc1>` ×8 (415-422) | Half-right: cluster0 → dcdc1, but cluster1 (cpu@400+) → **axp1530 dcdc1** (`reg_ext_dcdc1`, confirmed on HW — not tcs4838). | 🟠 |
| battery 5000 mAh / 4.35 V / OCV table (209) | Plausible but unverified; confirm on HW. | 🟡 |
| fan ch10/40000/inv, vibrator ch7/50000 (174-187) | **Correct** vs vendor (good) — but inert until PWM driver exists. | 🟢 |
| `&{/}` re-declaring SoC nodes | Wrong layering: SoC peripherals belong in an upstreamed `.dtsi`, not redeclared in the board file with made-up addresses. | 🟠 |

**Verdict:** treat the repo DTS as a *wishlist/scratchpad*, not a port. The honest,
buildable state is `sun55i-a523-trimui-smart-pro-s.dts` here (phase 1-2 only).

---

## 3. The one thing to verify first on real hardware

`i2cdetect` the r_i2c0 bus and dump PMIC ID register:
- Confirm PMIC at 0x34 and whether it answers as **AXP717** or **AXP2202**
  (board silk = AXP717C; vendor driver = axp2202; mainline only has axp717).
  *Strong signal it's axp2202:* vendor wifi/bt power rails are named
  `axp2202-aldo3/bldo1/bldo2` throughout — but still read the ID register.
- Confirm which CPU/GPU regulator is populated (0x36 axp1530 / 0x41 tcs4838 / 0x60 sy8827g). → **answered on HW: axp1530@0x36** (0x41/0x60 absent).
- `lsusb` / `dmesg` to identify the gamepad MCU and WiFi chip.
- `cat /sys/.../power_supply/*/` for real battery design capacity/voltages.

---

## 4. Phased bring-up plan

**Phase 0 — toolchain & boot path**
- Mainline U-Boot for A523 (or chainload from vendor U-Boot). UART0 console (PB pins).
- Build kernel `defconfig` + arm64, our DTS. Boot from microSD first.

**Phase 1 — console + storage** *(buildable today)*
- chosen/serial0, `&mmc0` (SD), `&mmc2` (eMMC), `&r_i2c0` + PMIC stub.
- Goal: kernel boots to shell over UART, sees SD + eMMC.

**Phase 2 — power + USB + WiFi** *(buildable today)*
- Full axp717 regulators + power button + battery; `cpu-supply` → CPU dcdc; OPP/cpufreq.
- `&usb_otg`/`&ehci*`/`&ohci*`/`&usbphy`. Identify + enable gamepad MCU over USB (evtest).
- `&mmc1` SDIO + WiFi node once chip identified.

**Phase 3 — needs new/forthcoming SoC drivers**
- Backlight: A523 PWM driver → `pwm-backlight`.
- Analog sticks: A523 GPADC driver → `adc-joystick`.
- Volume keys: depending on HW (LRADC or MCU).

**Phase 4 — display (hardest, now fully specced)**
- A523 Display Engine + MIPI-DSI driver (port from vendor / track upstream). Register
  maps: UM §5.1 (DE), §6.2 (MIPI DSI), §6.3 (TCON LCD). Addresses in `A523-DOCS-INDEX.md`.
- Panel: **DSI1**, 4-lane RGB888, lanes **PD10–PD19**, reset **PD22**, **720×1280@60**,
  62 MHz pclk. Timings + full MIPI DCS init/exit sequences are in the vendor DTB —
  write a panel driver (or panel-mipi-dsi with the init blob) directly from them.

**Phase 5 — audio, GPU (Mali), VPU**
- A523 audio codec driver; GPU = **Mali-G57 (Valhall, Job-Manager)** → driver is
  **Panfrost** (kernel `drm/panfrost` + Mesa Panfrost/PanVK), NOT Panthor (Panthor is
  CSF-only). The GPU is **already fully upstream** (v7.1): node + binding + driver all
  present — `gpu@1800000` in `sun55i-a523.dtsi` (status=disabled). Board work is just
  `&gpu { mali-supply = <…>; status = "okay"; }`, like cubie-a5e / avaota-a1. See
  `docs/GPU-NOTES.md`. Plus VPU when mainline support matures.

# Display driver port — status & plan

Live status of the MIPI-DSI display bring-up for the Trimui Smart Pro S (A523 / sun55iw3).
Background and the decoded panel spec are in [`DISPLAY-NOTES.md`](DISPLAY-NOTES.md);
this file tracks the *driver port* itself.

## ★★★★ 2026-10-28 — CURRENT: the "full-screen image" below was later shown to be backlight-only; the DE never completes a frame

Hardware re-testing after the 2026-09 status showed the panel is **not** displaying a real image —
the earlier "full-screen image" was backlight-only / unlocked mush. Bring-up is otherwise complete
(panel reset polarity fixed, DCS init ACKed, D-PHY PLL locked, TCON timing generator running, DSI
FSM reaching HS-data), but the **DE never clocks a frame out to the TCON**: DE `GLB_STS.FRAME_END`
never asserts, the TCON's 8080 `CPU_IF.rd_flag` never asserts, and the DSI transmit FIFO starves.
Every driver-controllable register now matches the same-board stock capture, and passive (register /
monitor) localization is exhausted — on this DE the RT mixer is a pure TCON-slave, so "DE can't
produce" and "DE isn't pulled" are the same event and cannot be told apart by reading registers.

The focused problem statement — full register evidence (mainline vs stock), everything ruled out, the
split-brain, and the open questions for the DE-v35x RCQ/RT backend — is in
[`A523-DE33-RT-HANDOFF-QUESTION.md`](A523-DE33-RT-HANDOFF-QUESTION.md). The remaining gap is the DE↔TCON
real-time frame-start / pull handshake in command/8080 mode (and a likely DSI video-vs-command-mode
model mismatch), which is below the level a register diff can resolve.

## 2026-09 (superseded by the 2026-10-28 note above) — earlier claim: full-screen image; colour (YUV) + refresh robustness

Since the 2026-08-10 status below (which had the DE33 mixer as the last blocker), the mixer
scanout was solved and the panel now displays a **full-screen image on hardware**. Three fixes lit
it, on top of the PHY/TCON work recorded below:

> **Reproducibility (2026-10-09):** these panel-lighting fixes are still in the build tree, not yet
> split into clean upstream patches. The complete raw diff that reproduces the on-HW display is captured
> at [`kernel/harvest-sun55i-de/drm-display-provisional.patch`](../kernel/harvest-sun55i-de/drm-display-provisional.patch)
> (apply to a pristine v7.2-rc3; raw/with debug, not upstream-clean). Splitting it into clean,
> upstream-shaped patches is the tracked follow-up.

- **RCQ (Register Config Queue) arm timing.** The A523 DE-v35x latches its DE33 registers via RCQ,
  and the commit must be *armed in the active region* (the driver was arming in blanking).
  Direct-MMIO writes only ever hit a shadow that never latched — the real "mixer not feeding a
  frame" root cause. With `use_rcq` + arm-at-target the RCQ ACCEPTs/FINISHes and the layer latches.
- **TCON CPU-interface (8080) trigger.** The DSI is driven a frame at a time via the TCON's CPU-IF
  trigger (stock 720×1280 timing), not a free-running RGB vblank.
- **DSI1 clock gate (the killer).** The panel is on **DSI1**; the tcon-top clock gate needs
  **bit 17** (dsi1), not just bit 16 (dsi0). With only bit 16 the DSI FIFO stayed empty → backlight
  but no image. Opening bits 16|17 fills the FIFO → image.

Follow-up: bypassing a stale device-output CSC cleared the *gross* channel corruption, and
**thermals/uniformity** were fixed by coupling the TCON/DSI/DISPLL clocks to the stock **62 MHz**
(an 11 %-fast 69 MHz was over-driving the panel).

**OPEN items (the display is not finished):**
1. **Colour — a YUV↔RGB conversion in the DE/DSI output path is still wrong.** The DCSC bypass fixed
   the gross corruption but colour is not yet correct. Suspects: DE output pixel format / FMT_CTL vs
   the DSI RGB888 packing (dt=0x3E) vs a lingering CSC selecting a YUV matrix.
2. **Continuous-refresh robustness** — the CPU-interface DSI needs a robust **per-frame retrigger**;
   the current path can starve (the retrigger leans on an IRQ that genirq can disable). Closely tied
   to item 2b below.
   - **2b. Keep the CRTC/mixer active.** On the bring-up rootfs the framebuffer console blanks
     (`fb0 blank=4`) ~10 s after boot and the DE mixer power-gates (`mixerGLB=0`); with no getty /
     no DRM client driving frames, nothing re-composits. It cannot be re-enabled at runtime here
     (`modetest` segfaults, `FBIOBLANK` unblank → EBUSY, sysfs blank write ignored, `/dev/fb0` writes
     land in the fbdev buffer but the gated mixer never scans them). Needs a driver fix to hold the
     CRTC active (or a working DRM modeset client), not a runtime poke.
3. **Clean upstreaming** — reshape the stack into upstream-acceptable patches, coordinating with the
   in-flight mainline DE33 rework rather than duplicating it.

**2026-09-22 (replacement board):** the DSI1-gate fix was re-confirmed on fresh hardware — the
deployed tcon_top was the pre-gate build (`GATE_SRC=0`, backlight only); swapping in the gate-in-probe
build gave `GATE_SRC=0x00030000` (bits 16|17 open), tcon-top bound, DISPLL locked, across reboots.
Remaining to a sustained visible image = item 2/2b above + deploying the 62 MHz set for colour (the
board currently boots the 69 MHz config).

The 2026-08 sections below are kept as the debugging record.

## ★★ 2026-08-10 (HISTORICAL — superseded by the current status above) — PHY + TCON + DSI all working; DE33 mixer was then the last blocker

We brought the display up **on real silicon** and cleared every layer except the DE33 mixer.
**The panel backlight is on**, the combo-PHY DISPLL locks, the TCON pixel clock is exactly 93 MHz,
and the DSI + panel are up in video mode. Two committed fixes got us here:

**Combo-PHY (committed `fd79778`) — the DISPLL locks on HW.** Four stacked bugs, all found by
on-device instrumentation (register read-backs):
- **Missing APB clock (the master bug):** the DT node had only `CLK_COMBOPHY_DSI1` (the 1188 MHz
  functional clock); the register block is gated by `CLK_BUS_MIPI_DSI1` (the same "bus" clock the
  DSI host uses). Without it every register access hit a dead block — the driver's own read-back was
  all-zero, including `PLL_REG0`'s non-zero reset defaults. Added it as "bus" + `CLK_COMBOPHY_DSI1`
  as "mod".
- **`ENLDOR` register-bit misdefine:** the DISPLL reference-LDO enable was `BIT(15)` (a reserved bit)
  instead of `BIT(18)`, so the LDO was never turned on.
- **Wrong ANA0/ANA4 analog trim** (from a BSP config *table* with a different register layout) →
  decoded the correct field values from the BSP `dsi_dphy_open()`: `ANA0=0x44`, `ANA4=0x844635ee`.
- **Halved PLL VCO dividers** → matched the BSP (VCO = 24 MHz × n, ÷(p+1)(m0+1); m1 = LP divider = 2).

Result: `pll_enable lock ret=0 dbg0=0x07700000`, `phy_power_on=0`, panel attaches over HS.

**TCON pixel clock (committed `b24145e`) — dclk is now 93 MHz.** The dclk was 0 because
`tcon->dclk` was **NULL** — never created. Root cause: `tcon_tv0` (the TCON-TV, `has_channel_0=false`)
binds *before* the LCD TCON so it grabs **CRTC 0**, but `sun6i_mipi_dsi` hardcodes the encoder to
`possible_crtcs = BIT(0)`. So the DSI drove the TCON-TV, `sun4i_dclk_create()` (gated on
`has_channel_0`) never ran, and `clk_set_rate(NULL)` was a silent no-op. Fix (DT): **disable
`tcon_tv0`** (no HDMI on this handheld) so the LCD TCON is CRTC 0, + `assigned-clocks tcon-ch0 =
372 MHz` so `pll-video0` is valid before the DSI mode-set. Verified: `dclk_null=0`, `sclk0=372 MHz`,
`dclk=93 MHz`; all display clocks correct + enabled (tcon-lcd1 372M, tcon-pixel-clock1 93M, mixer0
600M, combophy-dsi1 558M).

**The one remaining blocker — DE33 mixer scanout.** With everything above correct, the TCON is fully
configured and its vblank/`TRI_FINISH` IRQ is armed (`GINT0=0xc8000001`, `TCON0_CTL=0x81000000`,
`CPU_IF=0x10010005`) — but the IRQ never fires, so the CRTC page-flip never completes (backlight on,
no image). In DSI CPU-interface mode the vblank *is* the per-frame `TRI_FINISH`, which only fires
when a full frame is pushed **DE33 mixer → TCON → DSI**. So the mixer isn't producing/feeding a
frame — the original day-one scanout blocker, now isolated with every other layer solved.

**Resume plan for the mixer:** (1) verify the tcon-top mux still routes `mixer0 → tcon-lcd1` now that
`tcon_tv0` is disabled; (2) confirm the `sun6i_dsi` video engine actually starts (drives the TCON
trigger); (3) the DE33 mixer RCQ commit / BLD-layer apply. This is where adopting **mainline's DE33
mixer via drm-misc-next** may finally pay off — note (per the pivot below) that the migration would
*not* have fixed the TCON (its TCON path is byte-identical to ours), but it may fix the mixer.

> The 2026-08-06 pivot below ("base on drm-misc-next, and the panel lights = done") was optimistic:
> we instead fixed the PHY + TCON directly on our v7.2-rc3 tree, and the display needed real
> per-layer debugging. That section is kept for context; **this section is the live status.**

The most important update since the boot milestone: **mainline caught up.** `drm-misc-next`
(the DRM staging tree, v7.2-rc2 base) now carries the **entire A523 display pipeline**, so most
of our out-of-tree display work is redundant and the plan simplifies dramatically.

**Already upstream** (verified on the tree, `build-host:/root/opi4a-de33`):
- **DSI host** — `sun6i_mipi_dsi.c` has the `allwinner,sun55i-a523-mipi-dsi` variant.
- **TCON-LCD** — `sun4i_tcon.c` has the `allwinner,sun55i-a523-tcon-lcd` quirks.
- **DE33 mixer** — `sun8i_mixer.c` has `sun55i-a523-de33-mixer-0` (`sun55i_a523_mixer0_cfg`).
- **SoC DT pipeline** — `sun55i-a523.dtsi` wires `de`/`mixer`/`tcon-top` (enabled) →
  `tcon1@5502000` + `dsi1@5508000` (disabled, board-enabled) + a `dsi1_combo_phy@5509000`
  node, OF-graph complete.
- **Jernej Škrabec's DE33 fixes** ("drm/sun4i: Assorted display fixes") — merged (01–12).

**So our `0001` (DSI host), `0003` (SoC pipeline dtsi), `0004` (TCON-LCD), `0008` (DE33 mixer)
are now REDUNDANT — drop them.** Building them on drm-misc-next fails with `redefinition of
sun55i_a523_{lcd_quirks,mixer0_cfg,mipi_dsi_variant}` — proof the tree already has them. **The
`endpoint@1` OF-graph hack is also moot:** mainline's `tcon1_out` uses a plain `endpoint`
because upstream `sun6i_mipi_dsi` now registers a **drm_bridge** — the very fix for the
probe-defer we chased. That whole class of blocker is solved upstream.

**Still uniquely ours (keep):**
- **`0002` combo-PHY driver** — mainline references `allwinner,sun55i-a523-dsi-combo-phy` in the
  DT but ships **no driver** for it. The novel piece (and our DSI `-110` suspect).
- **`0007` panel driver** — `panel-trimui-smart-pro-s` (compiles clean on drm-misc-next).
- **`0006` PWM driver** — backlight only; optional for first scanout.
- **The board DTS** — mainline has no A523 board with a DSI panel; ours enables the pipeline +
  adds the panel node.

**New plan (staged, gated on the UART console):** base on **drm-misc-next**, drop the four
redundant patches, add the combo-PHY + panel (+ PWM) drivers, and write a Trimui board dts that
enables `tcon1`/`dsi1`/`dsi1_combo_phy` and adds the panel + backlight. Build `display=y`, then
test. **If the panel lights, the display is essentially done** (upstream scanout + our
combo-PHY/panel); if not, it is cleanly isolated to the combo-PHY alone. The obsolete
"forward-port the ut-slayer RCQ chain" plan is retired — see
[`DE35-ADOPTION-NOTES.md`](DE35-ADOPTION-NOTES.md).

The driver-compile history below is kept for provenance; the **live plan is this section**.

## BSP source of truth (found)

The vendor display stack is the official Allwinner AIOT SDK (public, **no NDA**):

| Repo | Use |
|---|---|
| `gitlab.com/tina5.0_aiot/lichee/bsp` (branch `product-aiot-stable`) | **vendor display drivers** (`sunxi-drm` framework) |
| `gitlab.com/tina5.0_aiot/lichee/linux-5.15` (branch `product-t527-linux`) | vendor kernel (no display in-tree; bsp overlays it) |
| `gitlab.com/tina5.0_aiot/product/docs` | datasheets / user manuals |

The BSP uses the **new `sunxi-drm`** framework (not legacy `disp2`). Key files
(`drivers/drm/` in the bsp repo):

| BSP file | Role |
|---|---|
| `sunxi_drm_dsi.c` (1664 lines) | MIPI-DSI host |
| `sunxi_device/hardware/lowlevel_lcd/dsi_v1.{c,h}`, `dsi_v1_type.h` | DSI register layer (**"dsi_v1"** IP) |
| `phy/sunxi_dsi_combophy.c` (1011), `sunxi_dsi_combophy_reg.{c,h}` | **combo D-PHY** (the new bit) |
| `sunxi_device/sunxi_tcon.c`, `sunxi_tcon_top.c` | TCON-LCD + TCON-TOP |
| `panel/panel-dsi.c` | generic DSI panel (init-sequence driver) |

(Checked out on the build host at `build-host:/root/trimui-display/aw-bsp-drivers`.)
Trimui does not publish kernel GPL source (only a toolchain SDK + firmware images),
and the community board trees — radxa/avaota/yuzukiHD — are mainline-style with no
vendor display stack. So this Allwinner BSP is the register/sequence reference.

## Architecture decision

**Extend the mainline `drm/sun4i` stack** (upstreamable) using the BSP + A523 User
Manual as register/sequence references — do *not* port the BSP `sunxi-drm` framework
wholesale (it is not upstreamable).

### Already in mainline 6.19 (big de-risk)

- **CCU** `ccu-sun55i-a523` already exports every display clock: `mipi-dsi1` (0xb28),
  `bus-mipi-dsi1` (0xb4c), `tcon-lcd1`, `combophy-dsi1` (0xb70), `bus-de` (0x60c).
- **DSI host** `sun6i_mipi_dsi.c` supports A31/A64/**A100** — same IP as the A523.
- **D-PHY** `phy-sun6i-mipi-dphy.c` has an A100 variant (reference for the combo-PHY).
- **TCON** `sun4i_tcon.c` goes up to `sun20i-d1-tcon-lcd` (DSI-capable) — extend it.

### Key finding (verified)

The A523 DSI host (`dsi_v1`) is **register-compatible** with the mainline driver:
same instruction-based command engine (`DSI_INST_ID_LP11/TBA/HSC/HSD/LPDT/HSCEXIT/
NOP/DLY/END`) and identical `dsi_basic_ctl` bitfields (`video_mode_burst`/`hsa_hse_dis`/
`hbp_dis`/`trail_fill`/`trail_inv`) ↔ `SUN6I_DSI_BASIC_CTL` BIT(0..3)+TRAIL_INV. So the
host port is a **variant add**, not a rewrite. The novel work is the **combo-PHY**.

## Progress

- [x] BSP source located + cloned; DSI host IP confirmed == mainline.
- [x] **DSI host: `allwinner,sun55i-a523-mipi-dsi` variant added** to `sun6i_mipi_dsi.c`
      + DT binding — compiles clean (linux 6.19). See
      [`../kernel/patches/0001-drm-sun4i-dsi-add-sun55i-a523-MIPI-DSI-host-variant.patch`](../kernel/patches/0001-drm-sun4i-dsi-add-sun55i-a523-MIPI-DSI-host-variant.patch).
- [x] **Combo-D-PHY driver** — `allwinner,sun55i-a523-dsi-combo-phy`, base
      0x05509000. New driver `kernel/drivers/phy-sun55i-dsi-combo.c` (ported from
      BSP `phy/sunxi_dsi_combophy.c`); integrated DISPLL PLL programmed from the
      `hs_clk_rate` passed via `phy_configure()` (so no separate clock provider).
      Kconfig/Makefile patch: `kernel/patches/0002-…`; binding:
      `kernel/bindings/allwinner,sun55i-a523-dsi-combo-phy.yaml`. Builds clean
      (W=1) as a module against 6.19. Clock = `CLK_COMBOPHY_DSI1`, reset
      `RST_BUS_MIPI_DSI1` (shared with the host). *Unverified until hardware:* PLL
      band math + analog trim are faithfully ported but untested on silicon.
- [x] **TCON-LCD** sun55i compat — `allwinner,sun55i-a523-tcon-lcd` added to
      `sun4i_tcon.c` (reuses the D1 LCD quirk: channel-0, `dclk_min_div=1`, r40
      mux) + binding. `kernel/patches/0004-…`. Builds clean.
- [x] **SoC dtsi nodes** — `dsi1`/`dsi1_combo_phy`/`tcon1` (real, default-disabled)
      + `de`/`display-top` (disabled skeletons, **no** compatible so they can't
      mis-bind until a DE driver exists) added to `sun55i-a523.dtsi`, OF graph
      de→tcon1→dsi1→panel. `kernel/patches/0003-…`. `make dtbs` clean; `dt-validate`
      passes. The board can now `#include trimui-panel.dtsi` (labels resolve).
- [x] **PWM** — `pwm-sun20i` driver (PWM v2 IP; ported from A. Shubin's D1 driver
      + `allwinner,sun55i-a523-pwm` compatible) in `kernel/drivers/pwm-sun20i.c`;
      `pwm0@2000c00` node added to the SoC dtsi (clocks bus/hosc/apb0 = CLK_BUS_PWM0/
      osc24M/CLK_APB0, reset RST_BUS_PWM0). `kernel/patches/0005` (node) + `0006`
      (Kconfig/Makefile). Builds clean on v7.1; the full **board+panel+pwm DTB
      now builds** (`make dtbs`, all of pwm/dsi/phy/panel nodes resolve).
- [x] **Panel** — `panel-trimui-smart-pro-s` DRM DSI driver
      (`kernel/drivers/panel-trimui-smart-pro-s.c`, compatible
      `trimui,smart-pro-s-panel`): 720x1280@60, 4-lane RGB888, reset PD22 (120 ms),
      power0/power1 supplies, backlight; replays the vendor init/exit DCS blobs in
      prepare()/unprepare() (modern `mipi_dsi_multi_context` API). Builds clean (W=1)
      on v7.1. `kernel/patches/0007` (Kconfig/Makefile) + binding. The DT panel
      node was slimmed to standard properties (driver owns mode/lanes/init) — this
      also dropped a stray `0x20` byte that had corrupted the init blob in the DTS.
- [ ] **DE3.5 mixer/CRTC** (`display-engine-v350`, 0x05000000) — the remaining
      blocker for any lit pixel (DSI+PHY+TCON probe, but nothing feeds the TCON).
      **De-risked:** v7.1 mainline now has DE33 support in `sun8i_mixer.c`
      (`SUN8I_MIXER_DE33` + the H616 cfg), and the A523 DE3.5 is DE33-class — so this
      is a **mixer-cfg + DT extension**, not a greenfield port.
      **Mixer cfg DONE** (`kernel/patches/0008`, builds clean on v7.1):
      `sun55i_a523_mixer0_cfg` (DE33, 3 VI + 3 UI, map `{0,1,2,6,7,8}`, scaler 0x3f) +
      `allwinner,sun55i-a523-de33-mixer-0` + binding; reg sub-ranges resolved
      (layers `0x05100000` / top `0x05000000` / display `0x05280000`).
      **Remaining = the DT assembly** (display-engine + bus@ + display_clocks reusing
      `sun50i-h616-de33-clk` + mixer node) — genuinely pioneering since *even H616 has no
      in-tree DE33 DT*; open unknowns (bus compatible, display_clocks offset/SRAM,
      `display-engine` compatible) tracked in
      [`../kernel/DE35-NOTES.md`](../kernel/DE35-NOTES.md). Until then `de@5000000`
      stays a disabled skeleton; pixel bring-up is a HW task.

**Status (2026-08-05, ON HARDWARE):** ★ the whole pipeline now **binds**. With DRM +
the sun4i display drivers built-in (`=y`) and the mainline DE33 mixer + tcon-top +
tcon-lcd1 + dsi + combo-phy all bound, the kernel creates **`card0`**, brings up the
**`DSI-1` connector**, **attaches the panel** (`sun6i-mipi-dsi: Attached device
smart-pro-s-panel`), and creates **`fb0`**. The LAST remaining blocker is now the
**DE33 mixer SCANOUT**: the CRTC never completes a page-flip (`vblank wait timed out`
/ `flip_done timed out` on loop) so no pixel scans out yet. See the milestone below.

## 2026-08-05 — card0 + panel ATTACHED on hardware (first mainline boot with display=y)

The Trimui now boots mainline Linux (SPL → BL31 → U-Boot → kernel → shell over UART) and,
with the display stack built-in, the full DE33 pipeline comes up. Two fixes were the key:

1. **`tcon1_out` OF-graph endpoint must be `@1` (reg=1)** — see `dts/trimui-de-reconcile.dtsi`.
   `sun4i_tcon_probe` calls `drm_of_find_panel_or_bridge(node, port 1, endpoint 0)`; with the
   TCON's DSI output endpoint at the implicit reg 0, that lookup *matched* it, followed to the
   DSI host (which is neither a panel nor a bridge), and returned `-EPROBE_DEFER` **forever** →
   the TCON never bound → the component master never aggregated → no `card0`. Mainline A64
   sidesteps this by putting `tcon0_out_dsi` at `endpoint@1`; doing the same (reg 1 + the
   port's `#address/#size-cells`) makes the lookup return `-ENODEV`, the TCON binds, and the
   DSI links back via its own port. **This single reg is what unblocks `card0`.**
2. **Build the display stack `=y`, not `=m`** — the minimal bring-up initramfs loads no modules,
   so `CONFIG_DRM`/`DRM_SUN4I`/`SUN6I_DSI`/`SUN8I_MIXER`/`SUN8I_TCON_TOP`/`PANEL_TRIMUI_SMART_PRO_S`
   must be built-in or nothing probes.

**Remaining blocker — DE33 mixer scanout (the "lit pixel"):** the CRTC/mixer never signals vblank,
so every atomic commit times out. The vblank IRQ comes from the TCON (`sun4i_tcon_handler`), so the
TCON isn't scanning out — likely the DE33 mixer not driving it (the RCQ "reports FINISH but doesn't
apply the BLD blocks" class of issue) and/or the DSI/combo-PHY clock feeding the TCON pixel clock.
There is also an intermittent DSI init `-110` (`sending dcs data ff 87 56 01 failed`) that appears to
be downstream of the mixer never running. **Plan:** rather than re-derive it, adopt the current
upstream DE33 fixes — Jernej Škrabec's "drm/sun4i: Assorted display fixes" series (DE3/DE33 mixer
routing, TCON-TOP) and/or the HW-proven A523 DE33 RCQ work from the ut-slayer / OrangePi-4A effort —
then re-test. See [`DE35-ADOPTION-NOTES.md`](DE35-ADOPTION-NOTES.md).

_Historical build notes (v7.1, driver-compile-only) below; the on-hardware tree is now v7.2-rc3._

## Build / test

**Canonical tree: `build-host:/root/trimui-display/linux-rc` = Linux v7.1.**
All four patches (`0001`–`0004`) + `phy-sun55i-dsi-combo.c` apply cleanly and build
clean (W=1) there with zero source changes — no 6.19→7.1 API churn.
`CONFIG_DRM_SUN4I/SUN6I_DSI/PHY_SUN6I_MIPI_DPHY/PHY_SUN55I_DSI_COMBO=m`. Checks:
`make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- drivers/gpu/drm/sun4i/sun6i_mipi_dsi.o`,
`… drivers/phy/allwinner/phy-sun55i-dsi-combo.o`, `… drivers/gpu/drm/sun4i/sun4i_tcon.o`,
and `… dtbs`. (Older tree `/root/rock3b-build/linux-mainline` = 6.19-rc5, kept as ref.)
The board+panel combined DTB additionally needs a `&pwm0` node (see PWM item).

# Trimui Smart Pro S — hardware bring-up runbook

## Where it stands

The device is up: mainline Linux (**v7.2-rc3**) boots to a shell on hardware — WiFi/BT, storage,
PMIC/battery, USB2, GPU, thermal/fan, and the input/audio/peripheral subsystems work, and the display
pipeline lights the panel (see the README for the live status). **Phases 0–5 below are done.** This
runbook is kept as the **reference + recovery procedure** — re-flash, brick recovery, or a
from-scratch bring-up on another unit. (It was written in the no-hardware phase against v7.1.)

**Golden rules (for any re-flash / recovery)**
- Do all of **Phase 1–2 (recon + backup) before writing anything to the device.**
- Boot our kernel from **microSD first**, never eMMC, until it's proven.
- First U-Boot boot is via **FEL (RAM-only)** — it touches no storage, so it can't brick.
- Keep the stock firmware (`trimui_tg5050_20251218_v1.0.1`) — it's the recovery path.

## 0. Tools & materials checklist

### Physical
| Item | Why | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| USB-C **data** cable | adb + FEL + fastboot over USB | not a charge-only cable |
| USB-to-TTL **3.3 V** serial adapter | kernel/U-Boot console (ttyS0) | **3.3 V, not 5 V** — UART0 = PB9 TX / PB10 RX, 115200 8N1 |
| microSD card (≥8 GB) | boot our kernel without touching eMMC | |
| Small tools / tweezers | open the case to reach UART pads; FEL button | find pads from a teardown photo |

### Host tools (this PC — already installed unless noted)
| Tool | Use | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `sunxi-fel` (sunxi-tools) | FEL recovery / RAM-boot U-Boot | ✅ installed, A523-capable |
| `adb`, `fastboot`, `lsusb` | shell on stock OS, fastboot, USB IDs | ✅ |
| `dtc`, `dd` | DT (de)compile, eMMC imaging | ✅ |
| serial terminal: `picocom`/`minicom`/`screen` | console | install: `sudo apt install picocom` |
| our U-Boot FEL image | `uboot-a523/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl-trimui.bin` | ✅ built |
| `recon.sh` | read-only day-1 collector | ✅ in repo root |
| `hw-verify.sh` | interactive guided verification + Markdown report generator; also guides the pre-rootfs phases below (`--bringup` = vendorboot/recon/backup/fel/sdboot) | ✅ in repo root |
| build host `build-host` | kernel build (`kernel/build-trimui-kernel.sh`) | ✅ |

### On-device (stock OS, pushed via adb if missing)
- `i2c-tools` (`i2cdetect`/`i2cget`) — to read the PMIC + regulator voltages. If the
  stock OS lacks it, push a static aarch64 `i2cget`/`i2cdetect` (or read via
  `/sys/class/regulator/*/`).
- `evtest` — to identify input devices (gamepad MCU, LRADC keys).

### Console WITHOUT the UART pads (no teardown / soldering)

The physical ttyS0 (PB9/PB10) needs opening the case + soldering. You can avoid it for
almost everything — serial is only genuinely irreplaceable for the earliest boot, and
even the DRAM step has a serial-free check:

1. **Stock-OS recon → use `adb`, no serial at all.** `adb shell` is your shell and
   `adb shell dmesg` is the stock kernel log (Phase 0/1 are fully covered over USB).
2. **Mainline kernel console → USB *gadget* serial over the usb/dp port.** Build the
   bring-up kernel with **`kernel/usb-gadget-console.config`** (merge on top of
   `trimui.config`) and add **`console=ttyGS0,115200`** to the cmdline. The device then
   shows up on the host as **`/dev/ttyACM0`**; read it with either:
   - **CLI:** `sh usb-console.sh` (auto-waits for the port, logs to a file — needs
     `picocom`/`screen`), or
   - **Browser (no install):** `usb-console.html` — a WebSerial reader. Serve it from
     localhost (`python3 -m http.server`, open `http://localhost:8000/usb-console.html`)
     in **Chrome/Edge**. Good for a locked-down office machine.
   - **Caveat:** the gadget console starts only at USB-gadget init — it misses SPL /
     U-Boot proper / the earliest pre-USB kernel lines. If the kernel dies *before* that,
     you're blind (then, and only then, is it teardown time).
   - Put the usb/dp OTG node in peripheral mode for a clean console (`dr_mode="peripheral"`
     on the bring-up DTB, overriding the role-switch); plugging into the host PC also
     forces MUSB peripheral.
3. **FEL DRAM validation → serial-free via `sunxi-fel` itself** (see Phase 3): run the SPL
   (DRAM init) then read/write-test DRAM over the same USB link — no console needed.

---

> Phases 0–4 can be driven interactively with **`hw-verify.sh --bringup`** (ids

## Phase 0 — Capture a fresh vendor boot log (golden reference)

Before anything else, record a **full kernel log from a cold boot of the stock
firmware** — the golden reference you diff the mainline boot against: vendor
driver **probe order** and bind points, the regulator/clock/PMIC init sequence,
input-device registration (the gamepad MCU), and thermal/cpufreq bring-up. The
earliest lines are the most valuable *and* the first lost once the kernel ring
buffer wraps, so capture on a **fresh power-on**.

```bash
# [A] Serial (best — also catches vendor U-Boot). 3.3V UART on ttyS0; start
#     logging BEFORE power-on:
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0 --logfile vendor-serial-boot-$(date +%F).log
# [B] adb (no disassembly) — grab dmesg promptly after a cold boot:
adb wait-for-device && adb shell dmesg > vendor-dmesg-boot-$(date +%F).log
# [C] recover a previous boot's log if the vendor kept one:
adb shell 'ls -l /sys/fs/pstore/ 2>/dev/null; cat /proc/last_kmsg 2>/dev/null'
# mine it for probe order + bind points:
grep -niE 'axp|regulator|dsi|tcon|disp|panel|aic|mmc|sdio|pwm|gpadc|lradc|input:|thermal|cpufreq' vendor-*-boot-*.log
```

Keep these logs — they pair with the Phase-1 recon (state) and `live.dtb` (topology).

---

## Phase 1 — Recon on the stock OS (READ-ONLY, zero risk)

Plug in USB-C, power on stock OS (adbd autostarts).

```bash
adb devices                       # confirm the device shows up
adb push recon.sh /tmp/ && adb shell sh /tmp/recon.sh | tee recon-$(date +%F).log
adb pull /sys/firmware/fdt live.dtb 2>/dev/null || \
  adb shell 'cat /sys/firmware/fdt' > live.dtb     # the running DTB
dtc -I dtb -O dts live.dtb -o live.dts             # decompile for reference
```

Then capture the HW-gated unknowns (commands run inside `adb shell`):
```bash
# PMIC: is it axp717 or axp2202? r_i2c0 = bus on PL0/PL1 (find its i2c-N number)
i2cdetect -l                                   # locate the r_i2c0 controller
i2cget -y <N> 0x34 0x03                         # chip-ID reg @0x34 (axp2202 bus)
# Regulator voltages we VERIFY (panel cldo1/cldo4, DRAM dcdc3, wifi aldo3/bldo1/2)
for r in /sys/class/regulator/*; do \
  echo "$(cat $r/name 2>/dev/null) $(cat $r/microvolts 2>/dev/null)"; done | sort -u
# CPU big-cluster regulator — RESOLVED on HW: axp1530@0x36 (0x41 tcs4838 absent); rescan to reconfirm
i2cdetect -y -r <N>
# WiFi/BT chip variant (AIC8800 D80 vs DC)
lsmod | grep -i aic ; ls /lib/firmware/ | grep -i aic
# Input: gamepad MCU + LRADC keys
cat /proc/bus/input/devices ; lsusb
# Storage partition map (so we don't clobber the wrong thing)
cat /proc/partitions ; ls -l /dev/block/by-name/ 2>/dev/null
dmesg | grep -iE 'dsi|tcon|disp|panel|axp|aic|mmc|pwm'   # vendor driver hints
```
Save all output. These map directly to files to fix — see the table at the end.

---

## Phase 2 — Back up the eMMC (BEFORE writing anything)

Brick insurance. Over adb (root) or from FEL/U-Boot later.
```bash
# whole eMMC (size from /proc/partitions; mmcblk0 is usually eMMC, mmcblk1 the SD)
adb shell 'dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0 bs=8M' > emmc-full-backup.img
# (or per-partition: boot/env/rootfs from /dev/block/by-name/)
sha256sum emmc-full-backup.img > emmc-full-backup.img.sha256
```
Keep this image and the stock firmware archive safe.

---

## Phase 3 — Brick-safe first boot via FEL (RAM-only, touches nothing)

This validates the U-Boot + the **DRAM retarget** without writing storage.

1. Console (optional): serial adapter `picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0` if you have the
   pads soldered — **otherwise skip it**, the DRAM check in step 4b is serial-free.
2. Enter FEL mode (try, in order): hold a button combo at power-on (A523 FEL combo —
   check XDA A523 FEL howto), **or** from stock: `adb reboot efex` / `adb reboot fel`.
3. Confirm + RAM-boot our U-Boot:
   ```bash
   sunxi-fel version                                  # must report A523 / sun55iw3
   sunxi-fel -v uboot uboot-a523/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl-trimui.bin
   ```
4. Check DRAM trained — **two ways:**
   - **(a) with serial:** DRAM trains + a U-Boot prompt appears → success, go to Phase 4.
   - **(b) NO serial — validate DRAM over the FEL USB link itself.** Run just the SPL
     (which does DRAM init) and then read/write-test DRAM (base **0x40000000** on A523):
     ```bash
     sunxi-fel spl uboot-a523/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl-trimui.bin   # runs SPL = DRAM init, returns to FEL
     sunxi-fel writel 0x40000000 0xdeadbeef && sunxi-fel readl 0x40000000   # must read back 0xdeadbeef
     sunxi-fel writel 0x60000000 0xa5a5a5a5 && sunxi-fel readl 0x60000000   # sweep another address
     ```
     Read-backs match across the range → **DRAM trained.** (If FEL can't touch DRAM after
     `spl`, or the pattern is corrupt, DRAM didn't train.)
   - **DRAM init hangs/errors** → tweak the 5 board params (`tpr2/6/10/11/12`) in
     `uboot/trimui-tg5050_defconfig`, rebuild U-Boot, retry. (See `uboot/DRAM-PARAMS.md`.)

---

## Phase 4 — Boot the mainline kernel from microSD (not eMMC)

1. **Build** (on `build-host`):
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 -b v7.1 \
     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux-trimui
   ./kernel/build-trimui-kernel.sh /root/trimui-display/linux-trimui /path/to/repo
   # → arch/arm64/boot/Image  +  …/allwinner/sun55i-a523-trimui-smart-pro-s.dtb  + modules
   ```
2. **Make a boot microSD**: partition (FAT boot + ext4 rootfs), put `Image` + the
   `.dtb` + a small rootfs (a distro arm64 rootfs or buildroot/initramfs). Use a
   U-Boot `boot.scr`/extlinux that loads `Image` + the dtb and sets
   `console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw`. (Daily-driver boot-time: once
   it's working, add `quiet` and a small/no initramfs; `CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=1` in the
   U-Boot defconfig keeps autoboot near-instant. Keep it verbose during bring-up.)
3. Boot from SD (in U-Boot: `load mmc 0:1 ...; booti ...`), watch the console.
4. **Verify, in order** (each is already wired in our DTS/drivers):
   - Console to a shell over ttyS0.
   - Storage: `lsblk` / `dmesg | grep mmc` (SD = mmc0, eMMC = mmc2).
   - PMIC: `dmesg | grep axp`, `ls /sys/class/regulator/`.
   - USB: `lsusb` on the OTG/host ports.
   - WiFi: needs the **AIC8800 out-of-tree module** (build separately) + the PM
     control GPIOs already in the DTS.

---

## Phase 5 — Resolve the HW-gated unknowns → update the tree

From Phase 1 output, fix and rebuild:
| Unknown (from recon) | File to update |
|---|---|
| PMIC = axp717 **or** axp2202 @0x34 | `dts/…-smart-pro-s.dts` `pmic@34` compatible |
| Real panel rails cldo1 / cldo4 voltages | panel `power0/1-supply` constraints + check vs MMC vqmmc share |
| `vdd-dram` exact (we set 1.10 V) | `reg_dcdc3` + `uboot/…_defconfig` `CONFIG_AXP_DCDC3_VOLT` |
| CPU big-cluster regulator — **RESOLVED: axp1530@0x36** (0x41 tcs4838 absent) | `cpu-supply` map (cluster1) = `reg_ext_dcdc1` |
| AIC8800 variant (D80/DC) | WiFi firmware dir + module build |
| Gamepad input source | add the right input node/driver (not gpio-keys) |
| eMMC/SD partition map | boot config + any flashing |

Rebuild and re-test after each change.

---

## Phase 6 — Display bring-up (the last DT + a lit pixel)

Everything below the DE is written + building; remaining = the **DE3.5 DT** and
HW tuning. See `kernel/DE35-NOTES.md`.

1. **Finish the DE DT** (the pioneering bit): add the `display-engine` aggregator +
   `bus@5000000` + `display_clocks` (reuse `allwinner,sun50i-h616-de33-clk`) + the
   `mixer@100000` node (3 regs `layers`/`top`/`display` = `0x05100000`/`0x05000000`/
   `0x05280000`), give `de@5000000` its compatible, and add
   `allwinner,sun55i-a523-display-engine` to `sun4i_drv.c`. The live DTB from Phase 1
   resolves the open unknowns (the DE-clk reg offset / SRAM, the bus compatible).
2. Boot; check the pipeline binds as one DRM device:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -iE 'sun4i-drm|sun8i-mixer|sun6i-mipi-dsi|combo|tcon|panel'
   ls /sys/class/drm/                      # expect card0 + connector DSI-1
   ```
3. Push a test pattern through the TCON/DSI:
   ```bash
   modetest -M sun4i-drm                    # list connectors/modes (libdrm-tests)
   modetest -M sun4i-drm -s <conn>@<crtc>:720x1280 -P <plane>@<crtc>:...   # solid colour
   ```
4. Panel + backlight: confirm `panel-trimui-smart-pro-s` probes, the init blob runs,
   `/sys/class/backlight/*` controls brightness. Tune as needed:
   - PHY: lane-rate band / analog trim (`phy-sun55i-dsi-combo.c`).
   - Mixer: blender `map[]`, `mod_rate` (`sun8i_mixer.c` cfg).
   - Panel: reset polarity (DT flag), init-sequence timing.

---

## Phase 7 — Input, audio, the rest

> Drive every step below interactively with **`hw-verify.sh`** (repo root): it
> guides each test (press a key, move a stick, listen for a tone…), captures the
> output, and writes a mainlining-ready report with the DT calibration values.
> `sh hw-verify.sh --help` · `--list` · `--demo` (no-device skeleton).

- **Input**: `evtest` → LRADC keys (vol/side, `lradc@2009800`), the gamepad
  (D-pad/ABXY — kernel source TBD from recon), AXP2202 power key.
  - **LRADC keys — confirm/calibrate (no multimeter):** the board keymap voltages
    (410 / 646 / 900 mV → Home / Vol+ / Vol−) are transcribed from the vendor DTB
    `key0/1/2`, so they should be right. **Confirm:** `evtest`, pick the LRADC device,
    press each of the 3 keys, check the right code fires (`KEY_HOMEPAGE` / `KEY_VOLUMEUP`
    / `KEY_VOLUMEDOWN`). If all fire → drop the `VERIFY` tags, done.
    **If a key doesn't fire / maps wrong** (mainline's r329-LRADC scale ≠ vendor 1350 mV
    ref): read the *measured* voltage in software — add a temporary
    `dev_info(dev, "lradc voltage=%u\n", voltage);` in the IRQ handler of
    `drivers/input/keyboard/sun4i-lradc-keys.c`, rebuild that module, press each button,
    read `dmesg`, and put those µV in the DT. If all three are off by the same ratio, fix
    `vref-supply` (currently `&reg_bldo2` / 1.8 V, tagged VERIFY) instead. (Alternatively
    `devmem2` the LRADC data register at `0x2009800`+offset while holding a key.)
- **Analog sticks**: GPADC (`adc-joystick`) — UM §8.4.
- **RGB LEDs**: already wired — `&ledc` enabled in the board DTS with 17 RGB LEDs
  (the LEDC node + driver landed in mainline v7.1; `allwinner,sun55i-a523-ledc`). Check
  `/sys/class/leds/` and test a channel; if colours are swapped, set
  `allwinner,pixel-format` (default grb). Confirm the count (vendor said 17).
- **Thermal + fan**: adopt M. Kalashnikov's A523 THS series (linux-sunxi, msgid
  `20250411003827…` / respin `20260504050245…`; not yet mainline) — it adds the THS0/1
  driver (`sun8i_thermal.c`, needs a "gpadc" clock + shared reset), a `sid@` node, and
  `ths@`/`thermal-zones` to `sun55i-a523.dtsi` + the binding. It's all SoC-level — apply
  his series (via `b4 am`), don't re-author. **Our board add-on** = the Trimui fan: a
  `pwm-fan` on **pwm0 ch10 / pin PB6** (vendor: 40000 ns period, **inverted**, 32 levels)
  plus a `cooling-map` in his `cpu` thermal-zone, so the THS sensors auto-throttle cpufreq
  and drive the fan. (Fan params from the vendor DTB; wire once his zones land + a build
  host is up.)
- **Audio**: the A523 codec (UM §4.1) — separate driver effort.
- **cpufreq/OPP, GPU** — Mali-G57 (Valhall JM) via **Panfrost** (NOT Panthor), already
  fully upstream (node+binding+driver). Board work = `&gpu { mali-supply = <…>; status =
  "okay"; }` once the GPU rail is confirmed on HW (vendor `mali-supply` phandle 0x20). See
  `GPU-NOTES.md`. Verify with **`hw-verify.sh gpu`** — it binds Panfrost, reads the devfreq
  OPP ladder, and does the programmed-vs-measured clock check that catches the A523 GPU
  **maskdiv overclock** (only M=0 OPPs are safe until the upstream `ccu_maskdiv` fix merges).

---

## Quick reference — what's done
The whole stack is up on hardware (v7.2-rc3): the boot chain, WiFi/BT, storage, PMIC/battery, USB2,
GPU, thermal/fan, and the input/audio/peripheral subsystems, plus the display pipeline lighting the
panel. The display is the remaining robustness + upstream work (colour, panel-IC heat, clean patches —
see [`DISPLAY-PORT-STATUS.md`](DISPLAY-PORT-STATUS.md)). Patches: `kernel/patches/`; drivers:
`kernel/drivers/`.

# Allwinner A523 / Trimui Smart Pro S — Mainline Linux

Mainline Linux bring-up for the **Trimui Smart Pro S** retro-gaming handheld
(board `A523-PRO2-AXP717C`, model TG5050), based on the Allwinner **A523**
(`sun55iw3p1`) — built on the upstream `sun55i-a523.dtsi` and modeled on the
`sun55i-t527-avaota-a1` board (same SoC family).

## Where things stand

**🎉 Mainline Linux boots on the device — all the way to an interactive shell.** The full
chain works on real silicon: **BROM → SPL → BL31 → U-Boot → distro-boot → Linux (v7.2-rc3)
→ busybox shell** (over a UART on PB9/PB10). Working today: 8× Cortex-A55 **SMP**, **DRAM**
(1 GiB), **microSD + eMMC** (the kernel `sunxi-mmc` new-timings path), the **AXP2202/AXP717
PMIC** + regulators, the **battery fuel gauge** (charge %, voltage, charge current/status, and
USB-power detection straight from the AXP717 hardware E-gauge), **USB2** host, the **Mali-G57
GPU** (Panfrost), the RTC, and — the latest — **on-board WiFi** (AIC8800D80 → `wlan0`), with the
device reachable **headless over Tailscale**.

**What cracked the months-long boot blocker** — all three were SPL-stage config bugs, all
found the moment a UART gave us eyes, and *none* were what we'd theorized:

1. **DRAM parameters** — the hand-decoded LPDDR4 timings failed training; the values proven
   on the Radxa Cubie A5E (same SoC + LPDDR4) train correctly and auto-size to 1 GiB.
2. **FIT sector** — the SPL read U-Boot from the wrong raw sector (a broken `spl_size`-based
   calc); pinned to the configured sector.
3. **FIT offset** — a stray `+8 KiB` `DATA_PART_OFFSET` overshot the FIT header.

The long-suspected "A523 U-Boot MMC driver" was **never** the problem — boot simply never
reached U-Boot. A real **`sun55i_a523` BL31** (from Jernej Škrabec's `a523-v4` TF-A branch)
+ mainline U-Boot do the rest. The U-Boot side is the
[`trimui-2026.10`](https://github.com/MidG971/u-boot/tree/trimui-2026.10) branch of our fork.

**WiFi + headless networking (latest).** On-board **WiFi is up on hardware** — the AIC8800D80 SDIO
chip enumerates on `mmc1`, firmware loads (from `/lib/firmware/aic8800_sdio/`), and **`wlan0` scans
and associates** (WPA2, 5 GHz VHT). The wall was the power-on sequence: the vendor `sunxi-rfkill`
drives **three** chip enables (`power_en` PL7 + `chip_en` PM5 + `wlan_regon` PM1) and mainline was
driving only `wlan_regon`, so the chip stayed silent to CMD5. Adding the other two + capping SDIO to
25 MHz (the A523 sunxi-mmc high-speed read sample-phase is uncalibrated → data reads CRC-fail) brings
it fully alive. The device now runs **headless** — a Debian rootfs auto-connects WiFi and brings up
**Tailscale** on boot (a `fake-hwclock` fixes the no-persistent-RTC clock that otherwise breaks TLS),
so it's reachable over the network without the UART. *(Fix committed: `29f4eee`.)*

**Warm reboot (fixed on hardware).** `reboot` used to freeze the SoC — the watchdog/PSCI resets
return to the SPL, which then hangs re-training warm DRAM, so cold power-cycling was the only way
back. The AXP717/AXP2202 PMIC can power-cycle the whole system (write `SOFT_PWROFF` reg `0x27`
bit 1 → PMU off then on), which unpowers DRAM for a clean cold training. A `mfd: axp20x` restart
handler (registered above the watchdog/PSCI) makes `reboot` use it; proven on hardware — the device
reboots and returns on its own. *(patch `kernel/patches/0036`.)*

**Inputs, audio & the side-board peripherals (latest).** A cluster of subsystems came up on hardware,
most unblocked by one discovery: **PK15 is the side-board +5 V master enable** — a single load-switch gate
feeding the two gamepad MCUs, the WS2812 RGB ring and the fan (never "board-blocked", just un-gated).
HW-confirmed working: the **side keys** (an LRADC `HOLD_KEY_EN` driver fix), the **power button** (AXP2202
PEK), the **vibrator** (PH12 + PWM), **analog audio** on headphones *and* the built-in speaker (a codec-ramp + reference-LDO fix), the **RGB LED ring** (17× WS2812), the **fan**, and **Bluetooth incl. A2DP audio** to a
headset. The two **gamepad MCUs** now stream (9600-baud serial, `uart5`/`uart7`); a uinput parser is in
progress.

**Display (the last big blocker).** Deferred to last — but a lot is
already solved on hardware: the panel's **backlight is on** and the
clock / PHY / TCON / DSI stack is solved on silicon.

> **Upstream status (read this first).** The A523 display support here is **ours — it is not in
> mainline.** It builds on mainline's generic `sun4i` DRM drivers (`sun4i_tcon.c`,
> `sun6i_mipi_dsi.c`, `sun8i_mixer.c`) and the **H616 DE33** rework (Jernej Škrabec) — none of which

Working on silicon: the from-scratch
**combo-PHY DISPLL locks** (`pll_enable ret=0`), the **TCON pixel clock** runs at the correct
**93 MHz**, and the **DSI** comes up in video mode with the **panel attached + initialised**. Two
bugs were cracked to get there:

- **Combo-PHY was writing into a dead block** — its DT node was missing the APB register clock
  (`CLK_BUS_MIPI_DSI1`), so every register read/wrote to an unclocked block (all-zero read-back).
  With that plus a register-bit (ENLDOR) misdefine, wrong analog trim, and wrong PLL dividers all
  corrected, the DISPLL locks. *(HW-verified; committed.)*
- **The DSI was driving the wrong TCON** — `tcon_tv0` (the TCON-TV, no channel-0) binds before the
  LCD TCON and grabs **CRTC 0**, but `sun6i_mipi_dsi` hardcodes the encoder to `possible_crtcs =
  BIT(0)`. So `sun4i_dclk_create()` never ran on the LCD TCON and its pixel clock was NULL.
  Disabling `tcon_tv0` (no HDMI on this handheld) + pinning `tcon-ch0` to 372 MHz fixes it — dclk
  is now exactly 93 MHz. *(HW-verified; committed.)*

**The pipeline now runs end-to-end — the panel displays a full-screen image on silicon.** An
A523-specific **continuous-TCON vblank rework** got the CRTC vblank firing and every atomic commit
completing (no more `flip_done` timeouts), and three further fixes lit the panel:

- the **RCQ (Register Config Queue) arm timing** — the A523 DE-v35x latches its DE33 registers via
  RCQ, which must be kicked in the *active* region; direct-MMIO writes only ever hit a shadow that
  never latched;
- the **TCON CPU-interface (8080) trigger** that drives the DSI a frame at a time; and
- the killer, the **DSI1 clock gate** in the TCON-top — this panel is on **DSI1** (gate bit 17), not
  DSI0, so with only bit 16 set the DSI FIFO stayed empty.

With those, the panel shows a full-screen image; follow-up work fixed the **thermals + uniformity**
by coupling the TCON / DSI / DISPLL clocks down to the stock **62 MHz** (an 11 %-fast 69 MHz was
over-driving the panel), and bypassing a stale device-output CSC cleared the gross channel corruption.
But the **colour is still not right**: a residual **YUV↔RGB** conversion in the DE/DSI output path
remains to be sorted out.

**What's left on the display is colour, heat, and upstreaming — not first pixels:** the
**YUV↔RGB colour** conversion; the **panel-IC heat** — the DDIC overheats within a couple of minutes
and shows a thermal "fractal" artifact (the real robustness blocker, tied to the DSI HS-clock duty and
independent of the commit path); and reshaping the stack into clean, upstream-acceptable patches,
coordinating with the in-flight mainline DE33 work rather than duplicating it. A 2026-10-09 hardware
test showed the A523 DE also latches via **direct AHB** (like H616), so the upstream form can **drop
the BSP-derived RCQ engine** entirely — simplifying that last step.

The full boot journey + the SPL fixes are in
[`docs/BOOT-AND-FEL-NOTES.md`](docs/BOOT-AND-FEL-NOTES.md); the captured first boot to a shell
is [`docs/FIRST-MAINLINE-BOOT-2026-08-05.txt`](docs/FIRST-MAINLINE-BOOT-2026-08-05.txt). KNULLI
(a vendor-BSP CFW) also boots this board as a reference chain.
